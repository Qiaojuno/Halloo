1. View Name: How about GalleryDetailView or ContentDetailView or
  GalleryItemDetailView? Which sounds better to you?
  
  GalleryDetailView sounds good. Later we're going to have to add a simliar system to Dashboard for finished tasks, so we can reuse a similar name like DashboardDetailView or something''
  2. Navigation Style: Should this be:
    - Full screen cover (like profile onboarding)?
    - Navigation push (with back button)?
    - Modal sheet that can be dismissed?
    
    It will be full screen cover, sharing the same top nav bar as GalleryView and DashboardView. There will also the the same pill navigation bar at the bottom
    
  3. Back Navigation: How should users return to gallery - back
  button, swipe down, tap outside content?

using the navigation bar at the bottom

  Content Type Handling Questions:

  4. Photo Content: For photos, should we show:
    - Full screen photo with zoom/pan capabilities?
    - Photo + metadata (date, profile name, task info)?
    - Photo + SMS text response if any?
    
    In the figma file, it has Photo, and then below it there's text that says "task confirmed" followed by the Task name in bold and the time finished next to it.
    
  5. Text/SMS Content: For text messages, should we show:
    - Large, readable text version?
    - SMS conversation style (like Messages app)?
    - Text + associated task details?
    - Profile context (who sent it)?
    
    I want a SMS conversation style. We will recreate the text bubbles. I want them to look like the bubble.fill SF symbol (rounded rectangle with a right angle triangle on the bottom (left or right depending on receiver or sender))
    
  6. Profile Creation Events: For "create new profile" history
  items, should we show:
    - Profile details (name, relationship, join date)?
    - Profile creation timeline/steps?
    - Profile statistics?
    
    do it similar to photo Content. Show a big profile picture in the middle, on the bottom instead of "task confirmed" it's "profile created", then Name of progile in bold and on the right the time created'

  UI Layout Questions:

  7. Header: Should there be a header showing date, profile name, or
   task title?
   
   on top of the picture (or content), there's the date (Like Sept 1, 2025)'
  8. Action Buttons: Should users be able to:
    - Share the content?
    - Delete the item?
    - Mark as favorite?
    - Add notes/comments?
    
    None of these options yet, definetly in the future tho, for now it's just for archival purposes'

  Data Questions:

  9. Additional Info: Should we fetch more details when opening the
  detail view, or use existing gallery data?
  
  If there is more data we need that's not in gallery, let me know.'
  
  10. Related Content: Should we show related items (other photos
  from same day, other responses from same profile)?
  
  no

  Technical Questions:

  11. Existing Tap Handling: Does GalleryView currently handle taps,
   or do I need to add onTapGesture?
   
   yes, galleryView handles taps. currently, when clicking on the content squares it sends a empty popup. Look into appstructure.txt and ui txt files for context
   
  12. State Management: Should this detail view be part of existing
  ViewModels or need its own?
  
  Check, I believe we haven't added this yet'

  Please clarify these points so I can implement this feature with
  perfect understanding of your vision!
