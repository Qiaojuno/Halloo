 1. Which specific EnvironmentObject is
  missing? The crash could be
  ProfileViewModel OR another
  @EnvironmentObject dependency
  
  I was opening ProfileViews when it crashed
  
  2. Is Container.shared causing side
  effects during preview generation? (You
   confirmed we should create separate
  MockContainer)
  
  not sure, double check
  
  3. Are there hidden @EnvironmentObject
  dependencies in sub-components?
  
  not sure
  
  4. Is the issue with SwiftUI's Group{}
  preview structure itself?
  
  not sure
