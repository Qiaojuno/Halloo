ðŸŽ¯ Original Card Stack Analysis

  Image 1 - Empty State:

  - Large dark card with rounded corners
  - Paper airplane icon (white) in center
  - Text: "Your loved one's moments will appear here as beautiful
  cards"
  - Very clean, minimal design

  Image 2 - Active SMS Card:

  - Card header: "Done for today" with "Today" dropdown
  - Dark background with very slight orange/yellow cards peeking
  behind
  - SMS conversation layout:
    - Blue bubble (outgoing): "Reminder: It's time for Daily
  Check-in Call. Please confirm when completed."
    - Grey bubble (incoming): "Called the family, everyone is doing
  great!"
  - Small emoji icon (ðŸ˜Š) in bottom right corner
  -that's a area for the user to react to the card. We had a system where the user presses a (add emoji) button on the bottom left, and can react to the task with a emoji.'
  
  - Card title below: Shows task details

  Key Differences from Current Implementation:

  1. Empty state should show paper airplane + message, not emoji +
  different text
  
  2. Card stacking shows orange/yellow background cards peeking
  behind
  -there's a mock image task in the background, which is where the orange/yellow is comming from'
  
  3. Header section has "Done for today" + "Today" dropdown

  
  4. SMS bubbles are more refined with proper tails
  yes, uses same layout as gallery detail view bubbles
  
  5. Overall proportions are different - wider cards, different
  aspect ratio
  they should be 334 W by 453 H

  Should I start recreating this original design? I can see this is
  much more polished than what we currently have.
  
  yes!

  Are you sure you want me to completely replace the current
  implementation with this original design?
  
  yes! just the card stack tho
