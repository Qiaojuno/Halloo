//  Hallo
//
//  Purpose: Manages elderly profile creation and SMS confirmation workflow for family coordination
//  Key Features: 
//    • Elderly profile lifecycle management (create, edit, confirmation)
//    • SMS confirmation workflow with YES/NO response processing
//    • Real-time family synchronization across devices
//  Dependencies: DatabaseService, SMSService, AuthenticationService, DataSyncCoordinator
//  
//  Business Context: Critical bridge between families and elderly users via SMS confirmation
//  Critical Paths: Profile creation → SMS confirmation → Profile activation → Task scheduling readiness

/// Manages elderly profile creation, SMS confirmation, and family coordination workflow
///
/// This ViewModel handles the critical onboarding process for elderly family members,
/// managing their profiles from initial creation through SMS confirmation to active
/// status. It serves as the gateway that determines whether elderly users can receive
/// daily care reminders and task notifications.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities:
/// - **Profile Lifecycle Management**: Create, edit, and maintain elderly family member profiles
/// - **SMS Confirmation Orchestration**: Send confirmation texts and process YES/NO responses  
/// - **Family Coordination**: Sync profile changes across all family member devices
/// - **Validation & Security**: Ensure profile data integrity and prevent SMS abuse
/// - **Status Tracking**: Monitor confirmation states and profile readiness for task creation
///
/// ## Elderly Care Considerations:
/// - **Simple Confirmation Process**: Clear YES/NO SMS confirmation without complex steps
/// - **Patient Response Handling**: Accommodates delayed responses from elderly users
/// - **Multiple Retry Options**: Allows resending confirmation SMS if needed
/// - **Clear Status Communication**: Shows families exactly where each profile stands
///
/// ## Usage Example:
/// ```swift
/// let profileViewModel = container.makeProfileViewModel()
/// profileViewModel.profileName = "Grandma Rose"
/// profileViewModel.phoneNumber = "+1234567890"
/// profileViewModel.relationship = "Grandmother"
/// await profileViewModel.createProfile() // Sends SMS confirmation automatically
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Profiles must be SMS-confirmed before they can receive task reminders
/// - Note: Maximum 4 profiles per family user to prevent SMS overwhelming
/// - Warning: Phone number changes require re-confirmation via new SMS

    BUSINESS LOGIC: Profile Creation with SMS Confirmation Workflow
    
    CONTEXT: Families need to onboard elderly family members who may not be tech-savvy.
    The SMS confirmation process must be simple, clear, and respectful of elderly users'
    preferences and capabilities. Failed confirmations are a major user drop-off point.
    
    DESIGN DECISION: Automatic SMS confirmation upon profile creation
    - Alternative 1: Manual confirmation step (rejected - adds friction for families)
    - Alternative 2: Phone call confirmation (rejected - not scalable)  
    - Chosen Solution: Immediate SMS with clear YES/NO instructions
    
    ELDERLY IMPACT: The confirmation SMS uses simple, respectful language that explains
    the purpose clearly. Elderly users understand exactly what they're agreeing to
    and can easily decline with STOP.
    
    FAMILY COORDINATION: Profile creation immediately syncs across all family devices,
    allowing multiple family members to see confirmation status and avoid duplicate
    profile creation attempts.

    - Opt-out processed within 1 minute (TCPA requirement)
    - All future SMS blocked automatically
    - Audit trail maintained (date, method, keyword used)
    - Family notified to prevent confusion
