/// Gallery management for elderly care photo history and family memories
///
/// This ViewModel manages the visual timeline of elderly family member interactions,
/// displaying photos from task responses, profile creation events, and other family
/// moments. It provides filtering capabilities and real-time updates as elderly
/// users respond with photos via SMS.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities:
/// - **Photo History Display**: Chronological timeline of elderly response photos
/// - **Event Filtering**: Filter by task responses, profile creation, or show all
/// - **Real-time Updates**: Live photo feed as elderly users respond via SMS
/// - **Memory Management**: Efficient loading and caching of photo history
/// - **Family Context**: Group photos by elderly family member for easy browsing
///
/// ## Elderly Care Considerations:
/// - **Visual Engagement**: Photos provide evidence of elderly participation and wellbeing
/// - **Family Connection**: Visual timeline helps families stay connected with elderly daily life
/// - **Memory Preservation**: Creates lasting visual record of care journey
/// - **Easy Navigation**: Simple interface for families to browse elderly responses
///
/// ## Usage Example:
/// ```swift
/// let galleryViewModel = container.makeGalleryViewModel()
/// // Automatically loads gallery events and displays photo timeline
/// let events = galleryViewModel.galleryEvents
/// let filteredEvents = galleryViewModel.filteredEvents
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Gallery updates in real-time as elderly users send photo responses
/// - Note: Photos are cached for offline viewing and family sharing
/// - Warning: Large photo collections may require pagination for performance
