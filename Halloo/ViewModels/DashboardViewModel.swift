/// Central family dashboard for monitoring daily elderly care tasks and SMS response tracking
///
/// This ViewModel serves as the primary oversight interface for families managing elderly
/// care reminders. It provides real-time visibility into task completion, SMS responses,
/// and care adherence across all elderly family members, enabling proactive family
/// coordination and intervention when needed.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities:
/// - **Daily Task Oversight**: Real-time monitoring of all scheduled care tasks across elderly profiles
/// - **SMS Response Tracking**: Instant visibility into elderly SMS responses and completion status  
/// - **Overdue Task Management**: Proactive identification and family alerts for missed care tasks
/// - **Family Coordination**: Cross-device synchronization of care status and family notifications
/// - **Progress Analytics**: Weekly trends and completion rate tracking for care optimization
///
/// ## Elderly Care Considerations:
/// - **Non-Intrusive Monitoring**: Observes care without overwhelming elderly users with notifications
/// - **Family Peace of Mind**: Provides clear visibility into elderly adherence and wellbeing
/// - **Timely Intervention**: Enables families to step in when care tasks are missed
/// - **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrates completion streaks and successful care patterns
///
/// ## Usage Example:
/// ```swift
/// let dashboardViewModel = container.makeDashboardViewModel()
/// // Automatically loads today's tasks and SMS responses
/// let todaysTasks = dashboardViewModel.todaysTasks
/// let overdueCount = dashboardViewModel.overdueTasks.count
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Dashboard updates in real-time as elderly users respond to SMS reminders
/// - Note: Automatically refreshes every minute to ensure current care status visibility
/// - Warning: Overdue task alerts require family intervention to prevent care gaps

    DESIGN DECISION: Parallel data loading with task grouping
    - Alternative 1: Sequential loading (rejected - too slow for family urgency)
    - Alternative 2: Background refresh only (rejected - families need immediate data)  
    - Chosen Solution: Parallel loading with immediate UI updates
    
    FAMILY IMPACT: Fast dashboard loading enables real-time family coordination.
    When elderly users complete tasks via SMS, families see updates within seconds,
    building confidence in the care monitoring system.
    
    CARE COORDINATION: Dashboard aggregates data from multiple elderly profiles,
    providing families with unified view of all care responsibilities and enabling
    prioritized intervention for the most critical missed tasks.

    BUSINESS LOGIC: Family-Initiated Task Completion for Care Coordination
    
    CONTEXT: Sometimes elderly users complete care tasks but don't respond to SMS
    (phone issues, confusion, forgetting). Families need the ability to mark tasks
    complete to maintain accurate care records and prevent false overdue alerts.
    
    DESIGN DECISION: Create synthetic SMS response with family attribution
    - Alternative 1: Separate completion pathway (rejected - complicates analytics)
    - Alternative 2: No family completion option (rejected - creates false alerts)  
    - Chosen Solution: Attributed SMS response maintains data consistency
    
    FAMILY COORDINATION: Family completion immediately updates dashboard across all
    devices, preventing multiple family members from attempting intervention for
    the same task. Maintains care completion statistics for trend analysis.
    
    AUDIT TRAIL: Clear attribution shows which tasks were family-completed vs
    elderly self-reported, enabling analysis of elderly independence patterns.
