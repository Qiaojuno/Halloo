/// Guides families through comprehensive onboarding and elderly care education workflow
///
/// This ViewModel manages the critical first-time user experience that introduces families
/// to elderly care coordination concepts, collects essential user information, and prepares
/// them for successful elderly profile creation and SMS reminder management. It serves as
/// the foundation for building family confidence in digital elderly care coordination.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities:
/// - **Educational Onboarding**: Introduce families to elderly care coordination concepts
/// - **Account Setup**: Secure authentication with email/password or social providers
/// - **Care Needs Assessment**: Personalized quiz to understand family's elderly care context
/// - **Preference Configuration**: Setup notification and communication preferences
/// - **Trial Activation**: Enable 3-day free trial for immediate elderly care access
///
/// ## Elderly Care Considerations:
/// - **Family Education**: Explains SMS confirmation process and elderly user respect
/// - **Realistic Expectations**: Sets appropriate expectations for elderly tech comfort levels
/// - **Care Priority Guidance**: Helps families identify most important reminder types
/// - **Gentle Introduction**: Avoids overwhelming families with complex care concepts
///
/// ## Usage Example:
/// ```swift
/// let onboardingViewModel = container.makeOnboardingViewModel()
/// // User progresses through: Welcome → SignUp → Quiz → Preferences → Complete
/// await onboardingViewModel.nextStep() // Advances through onboarding flow
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Onboarding completion enables elderly profile creation and SMS reminders
/// - Note: Quiz answers inform care recommendations and default reminder configurations
/// - Warning: Incomplete onboarding prevents access to elderly care coordination features

    creation and SMS confirmation workflow, allowing families to start
    coordinating care within minutes of signing up.

    experience SMS confirmation, set up daily reminders, and see elderly
