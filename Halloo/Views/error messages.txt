1. Header Logo: Should I use the
  exact same "halloo." styling as
  DashboardView's header, or does "TASK
   GALLERY" replace the logo entirely?
  2. Date Grouping: Do you want date
  headers ABOVE each photo group (like
  iOS Photos app), or integrated
  differently?
  3. Profile Avatars: Should these be
  the same profile avatar system we
  implemented for DashboardView with
  the pastel backgrounds and color
  coding?
  4. Filter vs Current Implementation:
  The current filter system is
  horizontal scrollable buttons - do
  you want to keep this or switch to a
  dropdown/modal triggered by the
  hamburger menu?
  5. Photo Layout: The requirements
  mention "square aspect ratio" but
  current implementation shows photos
  with task info cards below - should
  photos be pure squares with overlaid
  avatars only?
  6. Bottom Tab Integration: Since
  we're in a TabView system, should I
  remove the NavigationView wrapper and
   rely on the parent ContentView's
  TabView?
  7. User Avatar: Should this be the
  same profile icon system from
  DashboardView, or a different user
  avatar representing the app user
  (caregiver)?
  8. Data Source: The requirements
  mention "SMS-based photo
  verification" - are we still using
  the SMSResponse model or do we need
  to adapt to a different data
  structure?
