# Quick Start Guide for Next Session

## 🎯 WHERE WE LEFT OFF

**Last Session:** 2025-10-08 - iOS-native habit deletion animation ✅

**Latest Fixes (2025-10-08):**
- ✅ Habit deletion with smooth slide-away animation
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)
- ✅ Gesture direction detection (no scroll conflicts)
- ✅ Direct Firestore path deletion (no index requirements)

**Previous Fixes (2025-10-07):**
- ✅ Auth navigation fixed (login → dashboard)
- ✅ Profile creation fixed (validation + user document)

**Current Status:**
- Habits view fully functional with native iOS delete animation
- Test data can be injected via purple flask button
- Profile exists with confirmed status

**Next Task:** Continue testing habit management features or SMS delivery

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### 1️⃣ Test Authentication ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-07)
```bash
# Authentication is now fully working:
✅ Sign in works on FIRST attempt
✅ Navigation to dashboard works immediately after sign-in
✅ Firestore security rules allow user data access
✅ Auth state changes trigger UI updates
```

### 2️⃣ Profile Creation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-07)
```bash
# Profile creation is now fully working:
✅ Validation simplified (only name + phone required)
✅ Relationship defaults to "Family Member"
✅ Photo is optional
✅ User document created automatically if missing
✅ Clear error messages on validation failure
```

**Result:** Profile created successfully and appears in dashboard (greyed out)

### 3️⃣ Test SMS Confirmation (5 minutes) ⏭️ NEXT
```bash
# Check elderly user's phone:
1. Look for SMS from your Twilio number
2. SMS should say something like "Hi Gma smith! Reply YES to confirm..."
3. Reply YES → Profile should become active (no longer greyed out)
4. OR Reply NO → Profile stays pending
```

**Expected:**
- SMS sent automatically after profile creation
- YES response makes profile active
- Profile color changes from grey to active

### 4️⃣ Create Test Habit (2 minutes)
```bash
# In the iOS app (after profile is confirmed):
1. Select the confirmed profile
2. Navigate to Habits tab or tap "Create Habit"
3. Fill habit form:
   - Name: "Take medication"
   - Time: 9:00 AM (or near-future for testing)
   - Days: Daily
4. Save habit
```

**Expected:**
- Habit appears in Habits list
- Shows scheduled time
- Will send SMS at scheduled time

### 5️⃣ Test Habit SMS Delivery (variable time)
```bash
# Wait for scheduled time or adjust habit time to near-future
1. Wait for reminder time
2. Check elderly user's phone for SMS
3. Test photo response (if implemented)
4. Verify response appears in app gallery
```

**Expected:** SMS sent at scheduled time with habit reminder

## 📁 KEY FILES

**Read First:**
- `CURRENT-SESSION-STATE.md` - Full context of everything done
- `MIGRATION-README.md` - Migration step-by-step guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - What changed and why

**Code Reference:**
- `Halloo/Services/FirebaseAuthenticationService.swift` - Auth service (ObservableObject)
- `Halloo/Models/Container.swift` - Singleton DI container
- `Halloo/Views/ContentView.swift` - Auth routing
- `migrate.js` - Migration script

## 🔥 CRITICAL INFO

**Authentication Architecture (FIXED):**
```
Firebase Auth State Change
  → setupAuthStateListener() fires
  → Updates @Published isAuthenticated
  → ContentView auto-updates
  → Shows login/dashboard
```

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Modify Container singleton registration
- ❌ Add manual Combine subscriptions
- ❌ Use `Task { }` (use `_Concurrency.Task.detached { }`)

**Schema Migration:**
```
OLD: /users/{userId}, /profiles/{profileId}
NEW: /users/{userId}/profiles/{profileId}
```

## 🚀 HOW TO RESUME

**Option A: Everything is working**
```bash
# Just continue with migration
npm run migrate:dry-run
npm run migrate:commit
npm run migrate:validate
```

**Option B: Need to debug auth**
```bash
# Read what changed
cat CHANGELOG.md

# Check singleton setup
grep -A 10 "registerSingleton" Halloo/Models/Container.swift

# Check auth listener
grep -A 20 "setupAuthStateListener" Halloo/Services/FirebaseAuthenticationService.swift
```

**Option C: Need to understand migration**
```bash
# Read migration guide
cat MIGRATION-README.md

# Check current database state
node check-data.js

# Test Firestore connection
node test-firestore.js
```

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Auth is fixed when:**
- ✅ Single sign-in works (no double sign-in)
- ✅ Logout returns to login screen
- ✅ No stuck screens

**Migration is done when:**
- ✅ `npm run migrate:validate` shows 100% integrity
- ✅ App works with nested schema
- ✅ Old collections can be deleted

## 🆘 IF STUCK

**Auth not working?**
→ Read `CHANGELOG.md` section "Fixed - Authentication Flow Restructuring"

**Migration script errors?**
→ Read `MIGRATION-README.md` section "Troubleshooting"

**Need full context?**
→ Read `CURRENT-SESSION-STATE.md`

**Need schema info?**
→ Read `FIREBASE-SCHEMA-CONTRACT.md`

## ⏱️ TIME ESTIMATE

- ✅ Test auth: COMPLETED
- ✅ Profile creation: COMPLETED
- Test SMS confirmation: 5 min
- Create test habit: 2 min
- Test habit SMS: Variable (depends on schedule)
- Optional Firebase check: 1 min

**Total: ~8 minutes** (excluding SMS delivery wait time)

## 🎯 CURRENT GOAL

Test complete elderly care workflow:
1. ✅ Auth working
2. ✅ Profile created
3. ⏭️ SMS confirmation
4. ⏭️ Habit creation
5. ⏭️ Habit SMS delivery

**You're at step 3 of 5. Profile created successfully, now test SMS flow.**
