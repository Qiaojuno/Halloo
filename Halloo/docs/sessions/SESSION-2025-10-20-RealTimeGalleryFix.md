# Real-Time Gallery Updates Fix

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Issue:** Gallery not updating when SMS webhook creates gallery events
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem Summary

Gallery UI was not updating in real-time when elderly users replied to SMS habit reminders via Twilio webhook, despite successful data flow through the entire chain (Webhook → Firestore → Real-time listener → AppState).

### Symptoms
- ✅ Twilio webhook successfully received SMS
- ✅ Webhook created `gallery_events` documents in Firestore
- ✅ Real-time listener received snapshot updates
- ✅ Events decoded and added to `AppState.galleryEvents`
- ❌ **Gallery UI remained empty** - no visual updates

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. @State vs @StateObject Bug
**File:** `ContentView.swift:33`

**Issue:** AppState was declared as `@State` instead of `@StateObject`

```swift
// ❌ WRONG - Doesn't subscribe to @Published properties
@State private var appState: AppState?

// ✅ CORRECT - Subscribes to all @Published properties
@StateObject private var appState: AppState = {
    let container = Container.shared
    return AppState(
        authService: container.resolve(AuthenticationServiceProtocol.self),
        databaseService: container.resolve(DatabaseServiceProtocol.self),
        dataSyncCoordinator: container.resolve(DataSyncCoordinator.self)
    )
}()
```

**Why This Matters:**
- `@State` is for simple value types (Int, String, Bool)
- SwiftUI only monitors the **variable itself** for reassignment
- Does NOT subscribe to `@Published` properties inside ObservableObject
- UI only updates if you reassign the entire variable

- `@StateObject` is for ObservableObject lifecycle management
- SwiftUI **subscribes** to all `@Published` properties
- UI updates automatically when ANY published property changes
- This makes `appState.galleryEvents.append()` trigger view updates

**Impact:** Data was reaching AppState but SwiftUI wasn't watching it, so UI never updated.

### 2. Event Type Rendering Bug
**File:** `GalleryView.swift:360`

**Issue:** Gallery hardcoded to only render `taskResponse` events, ignoring `profileCreated` events

```swift
// ❌ WRONG - Only renders taskResponse
ForEach(dateGroup.events) { event in
    GalleryPhotoView.taskResponse(
        event: event,
        profileInitial: getProfileInitial(for: event.profileId),
        profileSlot: getProfileSlot(for: event.profileId)
    )
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Renders based on event type
ForEach(dateGroup.events) { event in
    galleryEventView(for: event)
        .onTapGesture {
            selectedEventForDetail = event
        }
}
```

**Added helper function (lines 232-249):**
```swift
@ViewBuilder
private func galleryEventView(for event: GalleryHistoryEvent) -> some View {
    switch event.eventData {
    case .taskResponse:
        GalleryPhotoView.taskResponse(
            event: event,
            profileInitial: getProfileInitial(for: event.profileId),
            profileSlot: getProfileSlot(for: event.profileId)
        )
    case .profileCreated:
        GalleryPhotoView.profilePhoto(
            event: event,
            profileInitial: getProfileInitial(for: event.profileId),
            profileSlot: getProfileSlot(for: event.profileId)
        )
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Profile creation events were in data but rendered as nothing (invisible).

---

### 3. Listener Crash on Malformed Data
**File:** `FirebaseDatabaseService.swift:735`

**Issue:** Single bad event crashed entire listener, preventing ALL new events from loading

**Problem:** Old gallery events had `photoData: "<null>"` (JavaScript null instead of absent field), causing Swift Codable to fail with `keyNotFound("_0")` error.

```swift
// ❌ WRONG - Crashes entire listener on single bad event
do {
    let events = try documents.map { document in
        try self.decodeFromFirestore(document.data(), as: GalleryHistoryEvent.self)
    }
    subject.send(events)
} catch {
    subject.send(completion: .failure(error))  // Entire listener dies
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Skip bad events, continue processing
let events = documents.compactMap { document -> GalleryHistoryEvent? in
    do {
        return try self.decodeFromFirestore(document.data(), as: GalleryHistoryEvent.self)
    } catch {
        print("❌ [FirebaseDatabaseService] Failed to decode gallery event \(document.documentID) - SKIPPING")
        // Log detailed error information
        return nil  // Skip this event, continue with others
    }
}
subject.send(events)
```

**Impact:** Old corrupt event blocked all new events from appearing.

---

### 4. Duplicate Profile Creation Events
**File:** `ProfileViewModel.swift:1068`

**Issue:** Profile creation gallery events duplicated 20+ times on app launch

**Root Cause:**
- SMS real-time listener replays ALL historical messages on app launch
- `handleConfirmationResponse()` called for EVERY "YES" SMS
- `createGalleryEventForProfile()` had no deduplication
- Every app launch created new gallery events for old confirmations

**First Attempt (Failed):** Time-based check (30 seconds)
```swift
// ❌ INSUFFICIENT - Old confirmations bypass time check
if let confirmedAt = profile.confirmedAt {
    let timeSinceConfirmation = Date().timeIntervalSince(confirmedAt)
    if timeSinceConfirmation > 30 {
        return  // Skip if > 30 seconds ago
    }
}
```
**Why it failed:** `confirmedAt` is from original confirmation (days/weeks ago), so old SMS messages pass the check.

**Final Solution:** Set-based tracking

```swift
// Added at ProfileViewModel.swift:223-227
private var profilesWithGalleryEvents = Set<String>()

// Updated createGalleryEventForProfile() at lines 1584-1605
private func createGalleryEventForProfile(_ profile: ElderlyProfile, profileSlot: Int) {
    guard let userId = authService.currentUser?.uid else { return }

    // Check if gallery event already created for this profile
    if profilesWithGalleryEvents.contains(profile.id) {
        print("ℹ️ [ProfileViewModel] Gallery event already created for profile \(profile.name) - skipping duplicate")
        return
    }

    // Create gallery history event
    let galleryEvent = GalleryHistoryEvent.fromProfileCreation(
        userId: userId,
        profile: profile,
        profileSlot: profileSlot
    )

    _Concurrency.Task {
        do {
            try await self.databaseService.createGalleryHistoryEvent(galleryEvent)

            // Mark this profile as having a gallery event
            await MainActor.run {
                self.profilesWithGalleryEvents.insert(profile.id)
            }

            // Broadcast gallery event update to gallery views
            self.dataSyncCoordinator.broadcastGalleryEventUpdate(galleryEvent)

            print("✅ [ProfileViewModel] Created gallery event for profile \(profile.name)")

        } catch {
            logger.error("Creating gallery history event for profile failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents duplicates even when old SMS messages replayed on every app launch.

## Testing

### Test 1: Profile Creation Gallery Event
**Steps:**
1. Launch app
2. Create new elderly profile
3. Reply "YES" to confirmation SMS
4. Check gallery

**Expected:** Profile photo appears in gallery immediately
**Result:** ✅ PASSED

### Test 2: Habit Response Gallery Event
**Steps:**
1. Launch app
2. Reply "DONE" to habit reminder SMS
3. Check gallery

**Expected:** Habit completion photo appears in gallery immediately
**Result:** ⏳ PENDING (waiting for test after duplicate fix)

### Test 3: No Duplicate Profile Events
**Steps:**
1. Launch app (SMS listener replays old messages)
2. Check gallery and Firestore

**Expected:** No new duplicate profile events created
**Result:** ⏳ PENDING (Set-based tracking implemented, needs testing)

---

## Cleanup Script

**File:** `cleanup-gallery-duplicates.js`
**Purpose:** One-time script to remove duplicate gallery events from production Firestore

**Execution:**
```bash
node cleanup-gallery-duplicates.js
```

**Results:**
- Total events found: 70
- Duplicates deleted: 68
- Unique events kept: 2 (1 profileCreated, 1 taskResponse)

**Note:** Delete script after confirming Set-based deduplication prevents new duplicates.

---

## Debug Logging Added

**GalleryView.swift** (lines 476-488):
```swift
private var filteredEvents: [GalleryHistoryEvent] {
    print("🎨 [GalleryView] filteredEvents computed")
    print("🎨 [GalleryView] appState.galleryEvents.count = \(appState.galleryEvents.count)")

    if !appState.galleryEvents.isEmpty {
        print("🎨 [GalleryView] Gallery events available:")
        for event in appState.galleryEvents {
            print("   - Event ID: \(event.id), Type: \(event.eventType), Created: \(event.createdAt)")
        }
    }
    // ... filtering logic
}
```

**Purpose:** Verify data flow from AppState → GalleryView
**Remove:** After confirming production stability

## Technical Concepts

### SwiftUI Property Wrappers

| Wrapper | Use Case | Lifecycle | Subscribes to @Published |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `@State` | Simple value types (Int, String, Bool) | View-owned | ❌ NO |
| `@StateObject` | ObservableObject creation | View-owned, survives re-renders | ✅ YES |
| `@ObservedObject` | Passed ObservableObject | Parent-owned | ✅ YES |
| `@EnvironmentObject` | Injected from ancestor | Ancestor-owned | ✅ YES |

**Key Rule:** Use `@StateObject` when the view **creates** the ObservableObject. Use `@EnvironmentObject` when the view **receives** it from a parent.

### Fault-Tolerant Array Transformations

```swift
// ❌ Crashes on first error
let results = array.map { try transform($0) }

// ✅ Skips errors, continues processing
let results = array.compactMap {
    try? transform($0)  // Returns nil on error
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Real-time listeners with legacy/malformed data
- Migration scenarios with mixed schema versions
- Any situation where partial success is better than total failure

### Set-Based Deduplication

```swift
private var processedIds = Set<String>()

func process(item: Item) {
    guard !processedIds.contains(item.id) else { return }

    // Do work
    performAction(item)

    // Mark as processed
    processedIds.insert(item.id)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- O(1) lookup performance
- Survives across function calls (unlike time-based checks)
- Works even when replaying historical events

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test duplicate prevention:**
   - Relaunch app multiple times
   - Confirm no new profile event duplicates
   - If working, delete `cleanup-gallery-duplicates.js`

2. **Test habit response events:**
   - Reply "DONE" to habit SMS
   - Verify event appears in gallery immediately
   - Confirm no duplicate habit events

3. **Remove debug logging:**
   - Clean up console output in GalleryView
   - Remove `print` statements from `filteredEvents` and `groupedEventsByDate`

4. **Delete temporary files:**
   - `cleanup-gallery-duplicates.js`
   - `delete-old-test-habits.js`
   - `UI-UPDATE-FIX.md` (integrate into this doc)

## Lessons Learned

1. **@State vs @StateObject matters:** Using wrong property wrapper silently breaks reactive updates
2. **Fault tolerance is critical:** Single bad data point shouldn't crash entire feature
3. **Time-based deduplication insufficient:** Replayed messages bypass time checks; use Set-based tracking
4. **Type-specific rendering:** Don't hardcode single event type when data model supports multiple types
5. **Production has legacy data:** Always handle schema evolution gracefully with compactMap
