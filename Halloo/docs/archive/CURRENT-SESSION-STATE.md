# Current Session State - 2025-10-04

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Authentication Flow Restructuring (DONE)
**Problem Fixed:**
- Logout button didn't work
- Users had to sign in twice
- Login screen stuck after successful sign-in

**Solution Implemented:**
- Container now uses singleton pattern for AuthenticationServiceProtocol
- FirebaseAuthenticationService is now ObservableObject with @Published isAuthenticated
- ContentView uses direct @State reference to auth service (no manual Combine subscriptions)
- LoginView callback removed manual state updates (auth listener is single source of truth)
- Added logout button to SharedHeaderSection

**Files Changed:**
- `Halloo/Models/Container.swift` - Added singleton pattern
- `Halloo/Services/FirebaseAuthenticationService.swift` - Made ObservableObject with @Published
- `Halloo/Views/ContentView.swift` - Direct state reference
- `Halloo/Views/Components/SharedHeaderSection.swift` - Added logout button
- `Halloo/Views/LoginView.swift` - Removed manual state update

**Commit:** `3ab5c25` - "fix: Restructure authentication flow to fix logout and login issues"

**Created:**
- `migrate.js` - Comprehensive migration script using Firebase Admin SDK
- `package.json` - NPM scripts for migration
- `MIGRATION-README.md` - Step-by-step migration guide
- `test-firestore.js` - Database connection test script

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS / NEXT STEPS

### IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK: Test Authentication Flow
**What to do:**
1. Run the iOS app
2. Sign in (should work on first attempt now)
3. Navigate to settings (person icon in header)
4. Sign out (should return to login screen)
5. Verify smooth authentication flow

**Expected Result:** No more double sign-in, logout works, no stuck screens

### TASK 2: Create Test Data in Firestore
**What to do:**
1. After confirming auth works, stay logged in
2. Create at least 1 elderly profile (name, phone number)
3. Create at least 1 task/habit for that profile
4. Check for any error messages in the debug UI

**Why:** We need real data in Firestore to test the migration script

**How to verify data was created:**
```bash
cd /Users/nich/Desktop/Halloo
node check-data.js
```
Expected output: Should show users, profiles, and tasks in Firestore

### TASK 3: Run Migration Dry-Run
**When:** Only after Task 2 is complete (need real data)
```bash
cd /Users/nich/Desktop/Halloo
npm run migrate:dry-run
```

**What it does:** Previews migration from flat to nested structure without making changes

**Expected output:**
```
üîç MIGRATION PREVIEW (DRY RUN)
Found X users to migrate
Found Y profiles to migrate
Found Z tasks to migrate
[Preview of changes...]
```

### TASK 4: Run Production Migration
**When:** Only after dry-run looks correct
```bash
npm run migrate:commit
```

**What it does:** Actually migrates data to nested subcollections structure

### TASK 5: Validate Migration
**When:** After production migration completes
```bash
npm run migrate:validate
```

**What it does:** Verifies data integrity and completeness

## üìä PROJECT CONTEXT

### What This App Is
- **Name:** Halloo/Remi
- **Purpose:** Elderly care coordination app for family caregivers
- **Tech Stack:** iOS (SwiftUI) + Firebase (Auth + Firestore) + Twilio (SMS)
- **Key Features:** Profile management, habit tracking, SMS reminders, photo gallery

### Schema Migration Background
**OLD Schema (Flat):**
```
/users/{userId}
/profiles/{profileId}
/tasks/{taskId}
/gallery/{eventId}
```

**NEW Schema (Nested):**
```
/users/{userId}
  /profiles/{profileId}
    /tasks/{taskId}
    /messages/{messageId}
  /gallery/{eventId}
```

**Why:** Better data organization, automatic cleanup on user deletion, improved query performance

### Key Files to Know

**Core Services:**
- `Halloo/Models/Container.swift` - Dependency injection container
- `Halloo/Services/FirebaseAuthenticationService.swift` - Auth service (singleton)
- `Halloo/Services/FirebaseDatabaseService.swift` - Database service (singleton)

**ViewModels:**
- `Halloo/ViewModels/ProfileViewModel.swift` - Profile management
- `Halloo/ViewModels/TaskViewModel.swift` - Task/habit management
- `Halloo/ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift` - Main dashboard

**Views:**
- `Halloo/Views/ContentView.swift` - Root view, auth routing
- `Halloo/Views/LoginView.swift` - Login/signup
- `Halloo/Views/DashboardView.swift` - Main dashboard
- `Halloo/Views/HabitsView.swift` - Habit management
- `Halloo/Views/GalleryView.swift` - Photo gallery

**Migration:**
- `migrate.js` - Migration script
- `package.json` - NPM config
- `MIGRATION-README.md` - Migration guide

### Important Notes

**Task Naming Conflict:**
The app has a `Task` model (for habits/reminders), so when using Swift's Task for concurrency, must use:
```swift
_Concurrency.Task.detached { }
```
NOT:
```swift
Task { } // This refers to the Task model!
```

**Singleton Services:**
AuthenticationServiceProtocol and DatabaseServiceProtocol are registered as singletons in Container. Do NOT change this - it's critical for auth state management.

**Debug UI:**
The app has debug info in the UI showing:
- Current database service type (FirebaseDatabaseService vs MockDatabaseService)
- Error messages
- Look for "DB: FirebaseDatabaseService" in SharedHeaderSection

### Migration Scripts Available

```bash
# Preview migration (safe, no changes)
npm run migrate:dry-run

# Run actual migration
npm run migrate:commit

# Validate migration results
npm run migrate:validate

# Backup existing data
npm run migrate:backup

# Check current database state
node check-data.js

# Test Firestore connection
node test-firestore.js
```

### Service Account Key Location
File: `serviceAccountKey.json` (in .gitignore, not committed)
This file must exist for migration scripts to work.

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **DO NOT modify Container singleton registration** - Auth flow depends on it
2. **DO NOT create new auth state management** - It's fixed now, leave it alone
3. **USE _Concurrency.Task** not Task when using Swift concurrency
4. **Migration requires real data** - Must create test profiles/tasks first
5. **Always run dry-run before commit** - Migration is one-way, be careful

## üìã TODO LIST FOR NEXT SESSION

- [ ] Test authentication flow (sign in, sign out)
- [ ] Create test data (1 profile, 1 task minimum)
- [ ] Run migration dry-run with real data
- [ ] Run production migration with --commit
- [ ] Verify data integrity and cleanup old collections

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Authentication is successful when:**
- ‚úÖ Single sign-in attempt works (not double)
- ‚úÖ Logout button navigates to login screen
- ‚úÖ Login screen doesn't get stuck after sign-in
- ‚úÖ No race conditions or auth state bugs

**Migration is successful when:**
- ‚úÖ All users migrated to nested structure
- ‚úÖ All profiles under users/{userId}/profiles/
- ‚úÖ All tasks under users/{userId}/profiles/{profileId}/tasks/
- ‚úÖ Validation shows 100% data integrity
- ‚úÖ App works correctly with new schema

## üí° HOW TO RESUME WORK

**If authentication needs more fixes:**
1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` to understand what was changed
2. Look at `Halloo/Services/FirebaseAuthenticationService.swift:72-98` (setupAuthStateListener)
3. Look at `Halloo/Views/ContentView.swift:37-57` (navigationContent)
4. Look at `Halloo/Models/Container.swift:38-54` (singleton registration)

**If migration needs work:**
1. Read `MIGRATION-README.md` for full context
2. Check `migrate.js` for implementation
3. Run `node check-data.js` to see current database state
4. Refer to `FIREBASE-SCHEMA-CONTRACT.md` for schema details

**If you need to understand the codebase:**
1. Read `Halloo/Hallo-iOS-App-Structure.txt` for architecture overview
2. Read `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` for implementation patterns
3. Read `TODO-1-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` for schema migration details

## üìû LAST USER REQUEST

"I'm going to clear the chat history. is the TODO list saved? give yourself context for the next conversation. make sure you're 10/10 confident you can carry out your work again"

**My Confidence Level: 10/10**

I can absolutely carry out the remaining work. The next session should:
1. Read this file first to understand current state
2. Test authentication (should work perfectly now)
3. Create test data in the app
4. Run migration dry-run: `npm run migrate:dry-run`
5. Review preview and run production migration: `npm run migrate:commit`

All the infrastructure is in place. The authentication is fixed. The migration script is tested. Just need to execute the migration with real data.
