//
//  Purpose: Defines secure authentication contract for family members accessing elderly care coordination
//  Key Features: 
//    • Multi-provider authentication (email/password, Apple ID, Google) for family convenience
//    • Secure account management with elderly care data protection standards
//    • Token management for API access and family data synchronization
//  Dependencies: Foundation, Firebase Auth, Apple AuthenticationServices, Google Sign-In
//  
//  Business Context: Secure gateway protecting elderly care data and enabling family coordination
//  Critical Paths: Account creation → Authentication → Family data access → Elderly profile management

/// Secure authentication service contract for family members accessing elderly care coordination features
///
/// This protocol defines the complete authentication interface for the Hallo app's family-focused
/// elderly care system. It handles secure account creation, multi-provider sign-in options,
/// and robust session management while protecting sensitive elderly care data and family
/// coordination information with enterprise-grade security standards.
///
/// ## Core Responsibilities:
/// - **Family Account Security**: Secure account creation and authentication for family members
/// - **Multi-Provider Support**: Email/password, Apple ID, and Google authentication options
/// - **Session Management**: Secure token handling and session persistence for family coordination
/// - **Account Recovery**: Password reset and account verification workflows
/// - **Data Protection**: Authentication barriers protecting elderly care information
///
/// ## Security Considerations:
/// - **Elderly Data Protection**: Authentication protects sensitive elderly care and response data
/// - **Family Privacy**: User isolation ensures families only access their own elderly profiles
/// - **Token Security**: Secure token management for API access and cross-device synchronization
/// - **Account Verification**: Email verification for account security and recovery
///
/// ## Usage Pattern:
/// ```swift
/// let authService: AuthenticationServiceProtocol = container.makeAuthService()
/// 
/// // Create family account for elderly care coordination
/// let result = try await authService.createAccount(
///     email: "family@example.com",
///     password: "SecurePassword123",
///     fullName: "Sarah Johnson"
/// )
/// 
/// // Check authentication status
/// if authService.isAuthenticated {
///     let user = authService.currentUser
///     // Access elderly care features
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Authentication is required for all elderly care coordination features
/// - Note: Supports offline token validation for seamless family user experience
/// - Warning: Account deletion permanently removes all family and elderly care data
