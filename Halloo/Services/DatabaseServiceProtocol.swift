/// Comprehensive database service contract for elderly care coordination and family data management
///
/// This protocol defines the complete data persistence interface for the Hallo app's elderly
/// care coordination system. It encompasses all operations needed for families to manage
/// elderly profiles, coordinate care tasks, track SMS responses, and analyze care adherence
/// patterns across multiple family members and elderly users.
///
/// ## Core Responsibilities:
/// - **Family User Management**: Account creation, profile management, and subscription tracking
/// - **Elderly Profile Operations**: Profile lifecycle, SMS confirmation status, and care context
/// - **Task Coordination**: Care task scheduling, completion tracking, and family synchronization
/// - **SMS Response Processing**: Response storage, completion correlation, and communication history
/// - **Analytics & Reporting**: Care adherence analysis, family insights, and trend identification
///
/// ## Implementation Considerations:
/// - **Family Privacy**: All operations respect user isolation and family data boundaries
/// - **Real-Time Sync**: Support for live updates across family member devices
/// - **Offline Resilience**: Graceful handling of network interruptions during care coordination
/// - **Performance Optimization**: Efficient queries for time-sensitive elderly care operations
///
/// ## Usage Pattern:
/// ```swift
/// let databaseService: DatabaseServiceProtocol = container.makeDatabaseService()
/// 
/// // Create elderly profile
/// let profile = ElderlyProfile(name: "Grandma Rose", phoneNumber: "+1234567890")
/// try await databaseService.createElderlyProfile(profile)
/// 
/// // Track care task completion
/// let response = SMSResponse(taskId: taskId, isCompleted: true)
/// try await databaseService.createSMSResponse(response)
/// 
/// // Generate family care analytics
/// let analytics = try await databaseService.getUserAnalytics(for: userId)
/// ```
///
/// - Important: All operations maintain family data isolation and elderly care context
/// - Note: Supports both individual operations and batch processing for efficiency
/// - Warning: Care data persistence is critical for family peace of mind and elderly safety
